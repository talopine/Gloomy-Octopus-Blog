### I run a weekly online crafts evening on Zoom

You can find details [here](/virtual-crafts-evening/)

### Things I enjoy (and occasionally post about) include

* [hand crafts of various kinds -- sewing, knitting, quilting, woodworking, bookbinding, etc, etc, etc](/crafts/)
* [taking things apart and trying to put them back together](/home-diy/)
* [red carpet galas with Fashion!](/galas/)
* [books and reading, especially SFF](/books/)

### My current sewing machines are

* Pfaff 1475CD (the best of 1980s fanciness)
* Pfaff 1222 (chonky metal beast)
* Janome 634D (solid workaday overlocker)
* Singer 66 (gorgeous treadle machine with thistle decals)
* Janome CoverPro 2000CPX (mostly functional; could be way worse)

### Other nerd things

I also like other nerd things like computering and learning about coding and how to spend 2 hours automating a task that would have taken 30 min to do manually. For example, I wrote (am writing?) this blog in Hugo and you can see the bodgy source code at [my github page](http://www.github.com/talopine).

Influences on this code have included:

* etc
