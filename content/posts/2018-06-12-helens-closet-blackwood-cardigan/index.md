I'd been looking at the [Blackwood cardigan](https://helenscloset.ca/product/blackwood-cardigan-pdf-pattern) for some time and debating whether to spend the money on it, or whether to just go with the free pattern from Peppermint. But the Blackwood is more my shape and it wasn't that expensive, and it's been having a bad time with pattern adjustments and need a quick win, so I bought it, stuck it together and made one in a day.

Totally worth it.

I have now made two more and have been wearing them for weeks on end.
