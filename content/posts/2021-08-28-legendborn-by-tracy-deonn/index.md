Review

I read this because someone I follow on twitter RT-ed something that the author had posted about how she'd had a review in which the reviewer criticised her use of tropes and implied that she didn't realise that she'd used them, and that -- oddly enough -- these sorts of assumptions don't get made about white authors, only BIPOC authors. She had sensible things to say about tropes (they are not inherently a bad thing, and it's a question of how they are used, and that often they have not been fully explored in a context where the protagonist is not white). So I downloaded the free sample from Kindle, then I got to the end of that and bought the book, then I finished the book. It was fun; I recommend it.

The book is the first in a series of present day Arthurian YA fantasy, starring a young female Black protagonist and involving her interactions with a secret society based out of a college campus in the American South as a result of her mother's death three months previously.

It is an extremely American novel. I don't mean that in a negative way, like that they go to McDonalds and talk about people's bangs falling in front of their eyes and never spell colour properly. More that this is a book that is heavily influenced by history and specific times and places, and even though one of those times and places is mediaeval Wales, it's an inherently American book, and a Southern American book. It's very clear from the outset that there are issues of racism at play -- the protagonist (Bree) interacts early on with two people in positions of authority, and the interactions are racist and unpleasant for Bree. The book is filled with rage and anger -- again, I don't mean this in a negative way, or in the "why are Black women so angry??" way, because it's very clearly spelled out why Bree is angry, and why she has every damn right to be angry, and a lot of the internal progression is her coming to terms with that level of anger and learning how to live alongside it. I am not the best person to comment on this sort of thing, because I am not American and also extremely white, so I don't know shit about being a Black woman in the US. But I can theorise that being a Black woman in America involves living with a lot of rage, and having to deal with that on a day to day basis. The author talks at the end about having been a student at the University of North Carolina, and the experience of both loving one's school and knowing that it was not built for People Like Her. It must be extremely weird having to live with those competing realities. Like I said, I'm not suited to comment.

The bare bones of the story are that Bree the outsider gets involved in this ancient historical order dedicated to fighting demons and there's a gorgeous golden boy and also a mysterious dark and brooding boy, and so she's obviously torn between them. (That part is all very _Draco Dormiens_ but, c'mon, it's YA and relationship drama is a thing when you're 16.) That's not actually the main emotional thread of the book though, which is mostly about Bree coming to terms with the death of her mother in a car accident a few months earlier. Her mother's death is the catalyst for the awakening of Bree's own magical powers, so she's dealing with that at the same time as dealing with her own grief, plus discovering her own family's history -- something which, in stark comparison to the detailed tracing of lineage undertaken by the white members of the Order, was not available in great detail. (Because slavery - I probably should have mentioned that explicitly before this point, but this is all about the legacy of slavery.)

Look, the twist at the end is amazing, where you work out that actually she's the heir of Arthur, and all of their posturing and planning is for nothing because one of their predecessors was a rapist and an enslaver, and now they're just going to have to suck it up and bow down to this Black girl who they've spent the entire book belittling, but she's better than all of them, because her ancestors cared about her more than these people's ancestors cared about them.
