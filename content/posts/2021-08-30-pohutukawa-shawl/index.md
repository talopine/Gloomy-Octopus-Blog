Pattern: Pohutukawa Shawl  
Designer: Aroha Knits \[instagram\]  
Item type: Shawl - 3/4 style?  
Date bought:  
Date cast on:  
Date finished (main): Sunday 26 July 2020  
Date finished (complete): ??  
Yarn: Luxury 4 ply from Bendigo Woollen Mills in Koala colourway (main colour) and limited edition Rose Petals colourway (contrast colour). 1 skein of each used, with some remaining.  
Needles: 3.25mm Chiagoo metal circular interchangeable needles

Introduction:  
I saw pictures of this pattern on Instagram when it was released. I was immediately attracted by the photos, which were all diptychs, and there was one where the shawl was show with a picture of the tree it's named for, and it looked so much like the actual tree that I loved it conceptually on sight.

Needles:  
This was my first project with the Chiagoo interchangeables, and they are great for lace. I had been using KnitPicks birch needles, and they are far less pointy and therefore it's much more frustrating to do k2togs and so on. I really like the Chiagoo red cable too, which is very solid but still flexible. Having metal needles was also nice, because then I worried less about snapping them.

Yarn:  
I have used Bendigo Woollen Mills Luxury yarn before, although in 8ply and 10ply, and it's always been very servicable and nice to knit with. It's not splitty, and it spit splices well, and it feels sufficiently soft and warm, and not too scritchy. (Note that Sewing Helper does seem to think that her Fox Jumper in Luxury yarn is itchy, but it's also a very warm jumper and I think it was too hot to wear it the most recent time she did.) I've always found BWM to be pretty reasonably priced, but I have no idea about Knitting \[K\]norms and whether this is a Lower Class Yarn or not.

\[For reference: yarn snobbery is a dick thing to do. I personally prefer natural fibres in sewing because I like the breathability and feel better than poly and I always find acrylic a bit staticky, and so I tend to gravitate that way in yarn selection as well, but I am in a financial position to pick and choose. Not everyone is, and if you are sneering at people for using budget yarns or fabrics then you can GTFO. Gatekeepers like that can DIAF, as far as I'm concerned. You can make pretty and/or functional items in cheaper yarns for whatever reason and their value is still primarily the effort that you have put into them, not the materials from which they are constructed. (i.e. they are therefore INHERENTLY and INTRINSICALLY worthy and don't let anyone say otherwise.)

In addition -- although it is a COMPLETELY SEPARATE TOPIC -- indie dyers should charge the amount for yarn that they need to charge in order to have a sustainable business. Yes, this means that indie-dyed yarns are priced out of reach of many people, but this is not the fault of the dyers -- it is the fault of a capitalist society that has trained us into thinking that (a) our labour is not worth its actual price, and that (b) only those who work outside the home should be granted sufficient goods etc to survive.\]

End digression -- back to the specific yarn discussion: I was worried I'd run out of yarn, because I generally knit with a loose gauge, and the yardage required was under the amount I had but still. I did have another ball of Koala that I'd bought previously and made half a sock out of, which I would have used if necessary, even though it was a different dyelot, but I didn't have to.

In hindsight, the colours I used are a little more washed out than the actual tree is, but look, they match my overall wardrobe better than a hotter pink would have.

I haven't made the tassels yet, so I can't comment on the amount of contrast colour I actually have remaining, but there seems to be a reasonable amount at least. That one is more concerning, because it was a limited edition colourway (for Valentine's Day or something) and it's sold out now, but if all else fails I can do some alternating contrast tassels.

Gauge:  
I swatched, but who knows \*shrug\*.

Does anyone else have the problem of ending up with literally the same gauge \*no matter which\* size needles you change between? I had the same issue with my Arboreal Jumper, where every single swatch had the same gauge. Ended up going with \[one size under teh recommended size,\] because I do have a loose gauge -- although I have had to really focus on this lately, because I've been knitting stressed and everything's been way too tight (look there's a pandemic and the world is on fire; it's going to be like that)

Not that I washed and blocked the swatch....

It's a shawl -- the purpose of swatching is mostly to make sure you don't run out of yarn, right?

Pattern:

Things I really liked about the pattern:  
• at the end of each step, there were two stitch counts: one for the entire row, and one for the number of stitches in each segment of the shawl. This was nice because I only had to count up to 200+ by the end rather than 600+.  
• the yos were part of the stitch pattern

Overall, I liked the way the pattern was set out, but I do have a few comments and corrections:  
• \[error at the start of teh pattern\]  
• The i-cord bind off instruction was technically correct, but I found it confusing to read, because I thought I had to keep casting on 3 stitches as part of the repeated pattern, which was not right.  
• Error in counting at the end of the pattern, which was probably a result of:  
• The pattern is very recursive, which can lead to confusion.  
It's basically set out as:  
step 1  
step 2  
step 3 & 4  
step 5: repeat step 2  
step 6: repeat steps 3-5 \[i.e. do steps 3, 4, 2\]

so it's steps: 1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 3, 4, 2

which isn't really that hard, but I did have to think about things every time I got to the end of a step, and I think it's why the count got out at the end of the pattern

Other comments on the pattern:  
• I thought the lace would be a lot harder than it was, but after the first few rows of the lace, it's basically the same pattern on repeat for the rest of the section. The WS rows say to p everything except knit stiches, which you knit, and I thought that would be hard without paying attention, but it was actually easy, since there was only 1 k stitch per pattern repeat.  
• the raised line in the middle of the grey sections is a slip stitch thingo, and I was \*constantly\* getting a stitch out when I was doing it, and it wasn't the easiest thing to fix on the next row. (In fairness, I was watching Mr Octopus play computer games so there wasn't 100% knitting focus there - there was a lot of me going "OH NO BAD FISH!!" because he was about to get eaten by a Reaper Leviathan in Subnautica.) The best thing I found was to check each section quickly before moving on to the next section, just by looking at the sttiches and seeing if any of them deviated from the 1,2,1,2,1,2... pattern. This saved a lot of tinking.  
• the unused yarn is carried down the side of the piece, which I was initially unsure about because it is a little visible, but on the other hand, it was extremely nice getting to the end and only having to weave in 4 ends (two at the front, two at the back - like elephants in a Mini Minor)  
• the i-cord bind off took FOREVER omg. But it's pretty.

Designer:  
Was friendly when I emailed her at the start of the pattern when I was extremely confused due to the missing yos.  
Appears to be BIPOC and pro-things like BLM, which matters to me. \[Inclusive sizing in other patterns?\]

Garment:  
Will comment when completed.  
Pretty lightweight but seems warm.  
Am comparing with an 8ply weight shawl, so ofc it's lighter.

\--------
Started bind off on 23 July 2020 -- instructions were confusing, because I thought you had to repeat the CO 3, but that's just a preliminary step and you're only supposed to repeat the \[k2, k2top tbl, transfer 3 stitches on RH needle back to LH needle\] element. The instructions were technically sufficient, but I needed to look it up in order to get past the part where I kept adding more stitches.

Successfully got to the end with yarn remaining for the main colour, even though I thought it might be close.

There were counting errors in the last bit of the pattern, but if you do the maths, it works out as being an error, so I just kept going.

The stripe pattern is very simple to knit, but it's quite easy to get a stitch out in the two slip 1 rows (this is also because I was watching Subnautica and not 100% paying attention) so I found that the best thing to do was to check each section before continuing, because it was a massive pain to fix post facto, and I had to tink it back every time. A quick look along the row to see if there was any stitch that didn't fit the dyad pattern was sufficient, and honestly I think it was a stitch in time saves nine situation.

The lace pattern seems more complicated than it actually is. Once you get past the first few rows, the pattern is the same, just with slightly longer beginning and ending sequences on each section. The WS rows say to P everything except Ks, which you K. And I thought that would be hard, but it's actually just one K every 8 stitches, and that was pretty simple.

The structure of the pattern was good and bad. It was short which was nice, but it was slightly recursive, which confused me a little.

(so it was steps 1-5, and step 5 was repeat step 2, and then step 6 was repeat steps 3-5, which involved repeating step 2 as per step 5. I think that's how the counting error came in, because it was sometimes hard to keep track.)

I chose this pattern becasue I loved how the shawl really looked like the tree it was named after, and I wanted to have a tree shawl too. My colours are probably not bold enouhg, but they are also colours that match my wordrobe colour selection, so at least it's wearable by me.

The bind off is INTERMINABLE.
