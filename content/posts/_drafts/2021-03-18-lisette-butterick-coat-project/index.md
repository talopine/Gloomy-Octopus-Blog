- toile from curtains from grandmother's house
- Test swatch interfaced then washed -- seemed fine
- Washed yardage -- seemed fine too
- Worked out layout and block fused interfacing (crafts evening 18/3/21)
- making size XL -- apparently fabric requirements are 3.6m, but I have 2.9 (probably had 3 and it shrank a bit)

Notes:

- remember to shorten sleeves
- interface collar and front again
- make undercollar slightly smaller
- welt buttonhole
- bagged lining
