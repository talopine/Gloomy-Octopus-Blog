## Pattern

Birds and Bikes Sweater by Plucky Pigeon Knits

## Supplies

### Yarn

Bendigo Woollen Mills  
3 ply Classic (comes in a 500g cone) in Grey  
4 ply Luxury (200g) - Slate  
4 ply Luxury (remnants) - Tangerine  

### Needles

Chiaogoo 2.75mm  
(And whatever the smaller size is...)

## Process

Start date - cast on in November 2020??  
Third round of pigeons finished 16 June 2021 (third round has much more consistent tensions) End date

Fifth round of pigeons completed 9 August 2021 - divided for sleeves, was confused, emailed designer, think I know what to do?

Paused for a while, but restarted November 2021.

## Commentary

The bike chart was a bit painful, because it had some really long floats.
