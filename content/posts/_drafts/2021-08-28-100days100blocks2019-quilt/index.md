### Pattern

100 Days 100 Blocks quilt-along pattern by Gnome Angel

Saw the challenge on instagram when it was only about a week in, and it looked fun.

### Piecing

Took place over the QAL period, with some done slightly in advance or on the same day.

Documented on Instagram as per competition requirements.

Used a number of different machines -- Pfaff 1222 and Pfaff 2038 while 1222 was in the repair shop because of how I'd taken it apart...

Fabrics were literally anything that I had in my stash that was vaguely cotton or cotton-aligned. As the blocks progress numerically, you can see a shift through various different fabrics that I happened to have in vogue at the time. Towards the end, there are some different prints that turn up for the first time because I'd just made something out of that fabric and, thus, there were remnants.

There are also fabrics that were from my pre-sewing stash (I don't throw things out, and I have the space to store them, so there's a lot of history...) which included various curtains from my childhood and so on.

I can't remember if I started piecing using Gutermann, but I'd definitely switched to Rasant in various shades of grey fairly early on.

The sashing was a random cotton that I had in my stash (I think my mother was "going to make me a skirt" out of it, but it's been in my stash basket for literally years) and I think it works quite well because I really didn't use much black in the rest of the blocks, so it's a nice contrast. It also hadn't been used, so it was nice flat uncut yardage and was therefore easy to slice up into lines.

### Backing and Batting

Backing was Nerida Hansen cotton linen with Australian animal prints, which was really lovely but also I decided I'd never actually wear it because it's a bit too pink and cute? The remainder of the backing was the pink quilting cotton that I'd bought to line the bodice of the Upton dress I didn't make out of the Nerida Hansen fabric. It wasn't the best lining material -- too tough -- but was sturdy quilting cotton.

Batting was bought from Spotlight when they were having one of their regular 40% off batting sales. It's wool. It smelled pretty gross when it arrived, but it's aired out a lot since then.

### Quilting process

Pin basting was really hard -- I did it on the floor on carpet. This was before I'd done the table with clamps version of basting. I'm not sure if I'm going to redo it now I know there's a better way. Maybe if I do the initial straight lines and it bunches too much.

First lot of straight line quilting in the ditch was done with Rasant thread with black on top and off white in the bobbin. I used the Pfaff 2038 for the first few lines, but then I got the shits with it because it is a finicky mofo and was refusing to actually sew with proper tension. Switched back to my beloved Pfaff 1222 and zero problems.[^1]

I stitched in the ditch along the edges of the sashing, where the sashing was a continuous line from side to side. This has effectively created 50 separate sections consisting of one square block and one rectangle block. I am planning to do each block in <abbr title="Free Motion Quilting">FMQ</abbr> using my treadle Singer (on the grounds that this is basically the justification for why I own it).

I did start trying to do FMQ on the treadle Singer, but it was too hard for something I'd never done before, so I've switched to my trusty Pfaff 1222 and am doing a very bodgy job of making up swirls and stuff.

### Other notes

??

[^1]: Think I'm going to sell the Pfaff 2038, it annoys me each time I use it tbqh. I haven't seen terrible reviews of it around and maybe it's just that I can't be bothered to take the time to get to know it. But I don't really want to put in the work when I already have a machine I really love.
