#### Pattern / Designer

Emily Hundt of In The Folds has done a series of free patterns in collaboration with Peppermint Magazine, one of which is a jumpsuit that can be found here: [https://peppermintmag.com/sewing-school/jumpsuit/](https://peppermintmag.com/sewing-school/jumpsuit/)

#### Fabric

Linen from The Fabric Store, which I bought to make Colette Juniper pants out of, but the less said about that pattern the better... [^1] Luckily I'd bought extra, because I'd bought it when I was New To Sewing and always got too much fabric, rather than now where I try and get the smallest amount of yardage possible. It's the most gorgeous linen and I love the stripes so much.

[^1]: It was...poorly drafted.

#### Original version

This is mostly a post about the reconstruction that I had to do of this garment, but the background is that I needed something to wear to the wedding of family friends in January in Far North Queensland, and "linen jumpsuit" really ticks all the boxes for that sort of thing. I made a wearable toile out of lightweight cotton (maybe voile?? it's pretty thin) from Spotlight, and I've actually worn it a fair bit to work, despite the fact that I'm convinced it's about to rip at any second because the fabric is so light.[^2]

[^2]: I hate hot weather, and there's a point in a Sydney summer at which I just. stop. caring. about how strictly office-appropriate my outfits are, so long as I'm not dying of heatstroke.

Having made the toile, I managed to cut out and make the final version on deadline (although I did pack needles and matching thread in order to do any final finishing while I was out of town), and it was perfectly wedding appropriate.[^3]

[^3]: It was also a really lovely wedding and the Atherton Tablelands are a lovely place to visit.

Unfortunately -- and I genuinely don't know WTF happened here -- the seams started falling apart. I have no idea whether it's because the machine tension was off, or whether it was to do with the nature of the fabric (being quite a loose weave), but the seams were pulling apart something terrible and needed repair. As such, it's been languishing in my Black Hole Box Of Repairs for a while, until I got around to unpicking all the seams this week.

#### Revised version

Seems weird to refer to this as a revised version, because I'm not actually changing anything, but I'm going to flat fell the seams this time and see if that helps.
