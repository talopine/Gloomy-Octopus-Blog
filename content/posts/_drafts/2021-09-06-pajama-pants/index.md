Mr Octopus requested some pajama pants, so I am making him some for his birthday, even though it will be 29C on Saturday so really pajama time is over for the year...

## Pattern

Self-drafted, based on the pajama pants block inÂ _Metric pattern cutting for men_ by Winifred Aldrich.

## Supplies

Plaid cotton from Dawn's stash

2" elastic from bulk buy

Charcoal Rasant thread

## Process

Start date: 4 September  
End date

Drafted a pattern, based on waist sitting below the tummy.

Made one leg out of a defunct sheet.

Added additional height to the back.

Cut out plaid and sewed together.

1.5cm seam allowance to match with new Pfaff markings.

Overlocked the seam, then topstitched down at approximately 1/4" and 1.2".

Waistband: 1.5cm seam allowance, then 2" + 2" plus fold of cloth, then another 1.5cm seam allowance.

Sewed elastic in loop and then pinned waistband and stitched in ditch from the front.

Using the construction method from 7 Pines Design, except I did the more unnecessarily complicated version for the waistband because I didn't read the instructions properly

Will hem pants at c. 1" fold and then another fold.

Remember to add a label for the back.

Forgot to cut out pockets, but this was really a test anyway.
