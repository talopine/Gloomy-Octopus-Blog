Here is the story of why I made two silver bomber jackets.

## Pattern

Pattern for me: [Bobbi bomber by Style Arc](https://www.stylearc.com/shop/sewing-patterns/bobbi-bomber/)

Pattern for Sewing Helper: [Ollie jacket by Sew A Little Seam](https://www.sewalittleseam.com/product/ollie-bomber-jacket-pdf-pattern/)

## Supplies

The main fabric is approx. 2.5m of a silver bonded knit from Pitt Trading that was in a remnant sale, and I immediately thought of making a silver bomber jacket for Sewing Helper. Turned out that I did not require that much fabric to make a jacket for a child, and in fact had sufficient left over to cut out a jacket for me as well (and possibly also a pair of trousers for Sewing Helper, because they will make it look like she's wearing a volcanologist uniform).

The ribbing is cotton/lycra ribbing from A&R Fabrics a while back, that I'd bought to use in the waistband of the red corduroy Sequoia pants that I made. I had insufficient left over to make the waistband on my version, so I ordered more from a Chinese fabric seller on etsy, which looks very suitable.

The lining on SH's jacket is leftover bits of rayon knit from Spotlight (one with elephants, one with large cranes of the avian variety). I used knit because that's what the pattern instructions said, but I think I could have easily got away with using a woven, which would have given me some more interesting colour options.

The lining on mine is still TBD.

**Notions:** Both jackets required separating zippers, and I bought three silver/iridescent (55cm) and three rainbow (50cm) zips from BOO! Designs.

**Other**: Rasant grey thread -- #96 for construction and #191 for topstitching (at -5 offset setting)

## Process

### Ollie bomber

Overall this was pretty easy to make: I have one complaint and made one significant amendment.

The complaint is that I literally have no idea what I was supposed to do with the centre front of the collar, because the instructions did not make any sense to me. There were pictures, but they were photos rather than diagrams, which I personally find much harder to interpret. I looked at various other sets of instructions, but couldn't find anything helpful (the Style Arc instructions just said something along the lines of "attach the collar", but that's to be expected there) so I ignored the instructions and just went with what I thought would work. It turned out fine, but I can imagine it being confusing for people who aren't comfortable with just making shit up.

The significant amendment was for the welt pockets which, as designed, use a single pattern piece for the welt and the front pocket bag. Since I was using ribbing, I preferred to make only the welt out of ribbing, and to use lining fabric for the pocket bag pieces. This required some redrafting and conceptual thinking (welt pockets are a complete mindfuck for me, although they're honestly not that hard when you just follow all the steps, but if I'm trying to do something slightly different then I take a really long time) but I was greatly assisted by the following tutorial:

### Bobbi bomber

Lining fabric: Jocelyn Proust cockatoo print family from Nerida Hansen (I ended up having to piece one of the sleeves; I really thought I had more fabric left than I apparently did, but I guess even 4m of the stuff only goes so far!)

Start date: Thursday 5? August 2021

Tuesday 10 August: putting together the arms and body (no ribbing yet) - construction thread 96 Rasant, topstitching 191 Rasant at -5 offset setting

Going to make the pocket size bigger and make the welts wider.

Welt pockets -- 1" welt, with 1cm seam allowances -- had some issues drafting the pockets, but worked it out by drawing on the front pattern piece -- confusing top stitching -- also I cut too far on the first on and had to zigzag up the little welt triangles

End date
