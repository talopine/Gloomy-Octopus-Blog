## Pattern

[Jackie Trousers](https://byhandlondon.com/products/jackie-trousers-pdf-sewing-pattern) by By Hand London

## Supplies

Charcoal wool blend suiting from Pitt Trading

Yellow bee print quilting cotton from my mum?

Rasant charcoal thread #126 and then #136 when I ran out of the first one

## Process

Start date: ??

Made a muslin out of curtains, which was worth it because I brought the waist in a lot and shortened the legs a lot.

cut out???

Tuesday 22 March: sewed up legs -- there's no instruction to finish the crotch curve on the back leg, so not sure when they want you to do that, but probably when you were doing the front crotch

the pockets were a bit confusing in terms of where the notches were supposed to line up, in that I wasn't sure whether to ease them to match or whether it didn't matter (the pattern notches were probably in the right place; I'm just an inaccurate cutter)

Tried out new overlocker -- not extremely convinced? very noisy and cutting knife not that clean when there are pattern notches or something

End date
